DT2112 - Speech Technology - Final Project

# Task:
The attention scores produced by language models are a probabilistic normalisation of energy; these scores can serve as a measure of how important a particular word is in a sentence. In speech, the most important words in a sentence tend to have focus; knowing which words are prominent is important for predicting the prosody of the entire sentence. The unmodified output of an attention layer in a language model may be sufficient for this task; alternatively, it could be fine-tuned using acoustic evidence (e.g., by using pitch extracted from speech to reweight the attention scores). In any case, this project will need to be evaluated using a listening test.
